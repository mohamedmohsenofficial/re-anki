## Why Re-Anki Cards? 🚀

Traditional Anki templates are boring:  
❌ Dull design  
❌ Poor mobile responsiveness  
❌ No animations or visual feedback  
❌ Not friendly for RTL languages like Arabic  
❌ Generic, uninspiring template names  

**Re-Anki Cards change that** 👉 with templates that are:  
✅ Beautiful, animated, and responsive  
✅ Optimized for Dark Mode  
✅ Scientifically backed by memory research  
✅ Available in English & Arabic 🌍 (Full RTL support)  
✅ Fun to use, with inspiring template names & emojis  
✅ Visual effects like Confetti for correct answers 🎉

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Current mode: **Dark Mode only** for an eye-friendly experience  
- Design evolves: Templates may change based on user suggestions  
- RTL support: If a bug is reported in the RTL version, fixes are applied only to that version to ensure quality. The two versions may remain visually consistent but fixes differ depending on user reports  
- Contact & Suggestions: If you have any ideas or encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohsenofficial) or open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mohamedmohsenofficial/re-anki/issues).
